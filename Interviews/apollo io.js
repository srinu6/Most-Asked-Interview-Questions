// Overview
// For this technical interview, we will be creating a to-do list application. This assessment measures your ability to create a functional application from scratch and other skills like communication and critical thinking.

// Notes
// TodoMVC
// You can search for resources but not look at the structure and styles from the reference.
// You cannot use any CSS library/framework, such as Bootstrap/Tailwind.
// You cannot use ChatGPT, Bard, Copilot, or any other AI prompting tools to generate lines of code.
// You can use anything for state management.
// You can use any local/online IDE.
// You can use "✓" symbol to make styling easier.
// Time
// You have a maximum of 50 minutes for both functionality and styling, so ensure that you strategically allocate your time to cater to both these aspects.
// Using TypeScript or Redux is completely optional. Use them only if it makes your task efficient.
// For this particular task, functionality is the key priority. While the code structure is also important, it should be considered secondary in this context.

// Checklist
// Reference: TodoMVC
// Functionalities
// Create item

// Note: create is triggered by pressing Enter

// Complete item

// Note: use "✓" symbol to make styling easier

// Delete item

// Note: use “x” for the delete button

// Filter items

// Note: add “X items left”, and all item statuses
// Styling
// Note: no need to make the UI the same as the reference.

// The main input field and item rows should be centered and take 85% of the screen’s width with a max width of 500px.

// The item's middle section with the text should take up the entire row width minus the circle and “x”.

// The item rows should have non-overlapping borders.

// The circle should be empty if the item is not complete, and the circle should contain “✓” + the text should be stricken-through if the item is complete.

// The “x” should only show if the row is being hovered.

// The text should wrap along with the row and not overflow.

// The filters’ row elements should be adequately spaced, like from the reference.
