What are the main performance issues in React Native and what causes them?
Sample answer:

Some of the most common performance issues in React Native include:

High CPU usage: Offloading complex functions to the JavaScript thread can cause performance issues
Memory leak: Information can be lost in the Bridge during the transfer from the Primary to the React Native domains, especially in Android apps
Slow navigation: Multiple thread bridging can also cause slower navigation times

How can app performance be optimized in React Native?
Sample answer:

There are several techniques that we can use to optimize an appâ€™s performance in React Native, such as:

Remove all console statements
Resize and scale down images
Cache images internally
Compress or convert raw JSON data
Use code splitting for large lists
Schedule animations
Remove unnecessary libraries and features

How is React Native code processed to display the final output on the screen?
Sample answer: test Gorilla

The process for rendering code in React Native is the following:

When the app is opened, the main thread (or UI thread) starts execution by loading JavaScript bundles
Once the JavaScript code has been loaded successfully, the main thread sends it to the second JS thread where more calculations are performed
When React Native starts rendering, the reconciler algorithm generates a virtual DOM or layout, which is then sent to a third shadow thread
The shadow thread calculates a new DOM and sends the layout characteristics to the main UI thread
The UI thread then renders the received DOM for display on the mobile app

How is the entire React Native code processed to show the final output on a mobile screen
Sample answer: CHAT GPT


When you write React Native code and run it on a mobile device, several steps are involved in processing the code and displaying the final output on the screen. Here's an overview of the process:

React Native code is written using JavaScript and React components. These components are defined in .js files and are written using JSX, which is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files.

When you run your React Native code, it's first compiled into native code using the JavaScriptCore engine. This is done by the Metro bundler, which is a tool that's included with React Native. The Metro bundler takes your JavaScript code and compiles it into a single bundle that contains all the code necessary to run your app.

Once the JavaScript code is compiled, it's sent to the mobile device where it's executed by the JavaScriptCore engine. This engine is built into the mobile device's operating system and is responsible for running JavaScript code.

As your React Native code is executed, it interacts with the native components of the mobile device. For example, if you're building an app that displays a list of items, your React Native code might create a list component that's displayed on the screen. This list component is implemented using native code, which means that it's optimized for the mobile device and runs much faster than code that's written entirely in JavaScript.

As your React Native code interacts with the native components of the mobile device, it uses a bridge to communicate between the JavaScript code and the native code. The bridge is responsible for passing messages back and forth between the two environments, allowing them to work together seamlessly.

Finally, as your React Native code runs and interacts with the native components of the mobile device, it generates a view hierarchy that represents the final output that will be displayed on the screen. This view hierarchy is then rendered by the mobile device's graphics engine, which is responsible for drawing the final output on the screen.

Overall, the process of processing React Native code and displaying the final output on a mobile screen involves several steps, including compiling the code, executing it on the mobile device, interacting with native components, and generating a view hierarchy. However, thanks to the efficiency of the JavaScriptCore engine and the power of the native components of the mobile device, React Native apps can run quickly and smoothly, providing a great user experience.
